# This isn't working in it's current state.  The spec file is apparently just for windows, 
# it's still pulling in windows DLLs.  
# Maybe *you* want to make this file work, I just don't think it's necessary.

# If you're a linux user, you should run the program using Run_allele_submission.sh.

# TODO: Make a linux specific pyinstaller spec file that works.

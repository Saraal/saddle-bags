Download a webin jar from here:
https://github.com/enasequence/webin-cli/releases

The webin jar can go in this folder. Please remove the version name, and rename your .jar file to webin-cli.java. 

Pyinstaller includes the .jar in the bundled executable. It will look here.
This is the filename that Saddlebags and pyinstaller is looking for.

To use an alternative EMBL Jar file, you must change the Saddlebags Configuration to point at it.
